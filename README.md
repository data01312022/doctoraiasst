# Doctor AI Agent  
**Patient-Centric Clinical and Disease Diagnosis with Treatment Optimization**

## Inspiration
Doctor AI Agent was born from the need to support oncologists in making faster, more accurate decisions using multimodal data (EHR, genomics, imaging) while reducing manual effort and improving patient outcomes.

## What It Does
- Ingests patient data (structured & unstructured)
- Diagnoses diseases (e.g., cancer types/stages) using clinical reasoning
- Recommends personalized treatment plans based on NCCN and historical data
- Matches patients with relevant clinical trials using biomarkers
- Offers explainable outputs for doctors and patients

## How We Built It
**Tech Stack:**
- GCP: Vertex AI, BigQuery, Healthcare API, Cloud Storage
- LLMs: Med-PaLM 2, BioGPT, GPT-4 + RAG
- Agents: Built using LangChain, Agent Development Kits, Vertex AI
- Data: FHIR, DICOM, VCF (genomics), HL7
- UI: Streamlit App with Doctor Mode
**Agents:**
- `DataAgent`: Validates and processes patient data
- `DiagnosisAgent`: Infers conditions
- `TreatmentPlannerAgent`: Suggests treatment regimens
- `TrialMatcherAgent`: Matches trials

##  Challenges
| Problem | Resolution |
|--------|------------|
| Handling PII and compliance | GCP Healthcare APIs, HIPAA, GDPR |
| LLM hallucination | RAG with medical knowledge grounding |
| Complex data orchestration | Multi-agent coordination with LangGraph |
| Trust building with doctors | Explainable AI, Doctor UI with citations |
## Accomplishments
- >85% diagnostic support accuracy in test cases
- Real-time clinical trial matcher
- Integrated multi-modal clinical data
- Streamlined UX for doctors with override options

## What We Learned
- Domain-specific LLM tuning is essential
- Explainability & compliance are non-negotiable
- Agent-based systems scale efficiently for healthcare
- RAG makes LLMs more factual and trusted

## Whatâ€™s Next
- Expansion to cardiology & rare diseases
- Speech-based input for real-time consultation
- Digital twins for outcome simulation
- Clinical pilot deployment and regulatory pathways
